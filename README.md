## Introduction

Just a playground for building a front-end component library basing on GO templating.
The components are SSR when possible and enhanced by JS.

Custom web components are used and if possible, noscript fallback is provided.

## Components

- Accordion
- Checkbox group - checking selected item number
- Tags input - a list of tags for content 

## Forms

TODO: components have a validation interface and form submission can depend on positive validation on all inputs.
